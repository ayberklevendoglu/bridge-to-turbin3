This project demonstrates various Solana blockchain operations, including generating a wallet, claiming tokens, transferring tokens, emptying a wallet, and enrolling in a program. The project includes the following TypeScript files:

## Files

### 1. `keygen.ts`

Generates a Solana wallet and a secret key, then logs them into a file (`dev-wallet.json`). This wallet will be used in subsequent scripts.

### 2. `airdrop.ts`

Connects to the Solana Devnet and claims Devnet SOL tokens for the wallet generated by `keygen.ts`.

### 3. `transfer.ts`

Transfers SOL tokens from the generated wallet to a newly generated wallet. The script does the following:

- Connects to the Solana Devnet.
- Retrieves and logs the balances of the sender and recipient wallets.
- Creates a transaction to transfer 1 SOL from the sender to the recipient.
- Sends and confirms the transaction, then logs the transaction signature.

### 4. `emptyWallet.ts`

Empties the entire balance of the generated wallet to a newly generated wallet. The script does the following:

- Connects to the Solana Devnet.
- Retrieves and logs the balance of the sender wallet.
- Creates a transaction to transfer the entire balance minus the transaction fee to the recipient.
- Sends and confirms the transaction, then logs the transaction signature.

### 5. `enroll.ts`

Enrolls the generated wallet in a specific program. The script does the following:

- Connects to the Solana Devnet.
- Uses the `anchor` framework to interact with the program.
- Uses a predefined GitHub username to complete the enrollment.
- Logs the transaction signature or an error message if the transaction fails.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Before starting to create our keypair, make sure you have Node.js and yarn installed on your computer.
3. Ensure you have a Solana CLI and Devnet setup.
   ```bash
   npm install touch-cli -g
   ```

## Usage

1. Generate a wallet:
   ```bash
   yarn keygen
   ```
2. Airdrop Devnet SOL to the generated wallet:
   ```bash
   yarn airdrop
   ```
3. ransfer SOL from the generated wallet to another wallet:
   ```bash
   yarn transfer
   ```
4. Empty the balance of the generated wallet to another wallet:
   ```bash
   yarn emptyWallet
   ```
5. Enroll the generated wallet in a program:
   ```bash
   yarn enroll
   ```
